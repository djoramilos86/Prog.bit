                        is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the
                        switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the public switched telephone
                        network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture, and, therefore,

                        telephony, 2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other services, such as text messaging, MMS,

                        sales").[6] For feature phones (or "dumbphones") as of 2016, the largest were Samsung, Nokia, and
